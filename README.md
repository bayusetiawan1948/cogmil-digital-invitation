# Cogmil Digital Invitation

This project originated from an invitation to celebrate the New Year together. However, I felt that inviting people through broadcast chats was too ordinary and lacked impact. As a result, I created a website to humorously invite individuals who wish to join in the New Year celebration.

To run it, you can use the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

To build the project with Vite, follow these steps:

- Run the following command to build the project

```
npm run build
```

- Add the invitation folder, which contains the index.html file.
- Copy the content of the index.html file located in the root folder, and paste it into the index.html file in the invitation folder.
- And voila!
